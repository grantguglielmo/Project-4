 * Critter2 will randomly decide to either walk run or rest during a given doTimestep.
 * Critter2's preference on running or resting is decided by a random value picked at construction.
 * Its direction is randomly chosen during when it decides to walk or run.
 * During a fight Critter2 will begin reproducing until its energy drops
 * below the min_reproduce_energy parameter. Its children are sent off in random directions
 * and are given their parents runChance value. The Critter2 will then stay and fight
 * once it has exhausted its reproduction potential.

/**
 * This critter begins by randomly choosing a direction out of the possible eight. 
 * If the direction it chooses will not result in backtracking, then it will walk in that
 * direction. If the direction it chooses is the opposite of the last direction it walked,
 * it will instead reproduce, with the offspring's direction set as the last direction walked.
 * 
 * If the critter reproduced during the current time step, it will fight to protect it's 
 * offspring. Otherwise, it will choose not to fight.
